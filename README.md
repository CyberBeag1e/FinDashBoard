# FinDashBoard

A simple daily ledger, where you can track your expenditure/revenue, view your expenditure/revenue history, and get the summary of your past expenditure/revenue.

The project was built with PyQt5 version 5.15.11 and Python 3.12.5. Make sure you install the required packages before you run the `main.py` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Kind Reminders
- If you want to customize the categories of your expenditure/revenue, update `categories.py` file.
- The UI of the app is not well designed. If you want to customize the UI or the theme colors, use `style_sheet.py`.
